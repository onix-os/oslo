//! How a pipeline becomes an entry in the job table.
//!
//! The two ways a running command stops being the shell's foreground concern: it was started with
//! `&`, or the user suspended it. They are the same problem seen from two sides — a process group
//! the shell no longer waits for but must still be able to name — so they share a file, and both
//! end at [`crate::exec::job::with_jobs`].
//!
//! Split out of [`super`] to keep the evaluator about evaluation: nothing here decides a status
//! or runs a command, it only decides what the user is told and what the shell remembers.

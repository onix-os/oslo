//! Which builtins take *assignments* rather than words, and how one is recognised.
//!
//! POSIX calls these declaration utilities. The difference is not cosmetic: their `name=value`
//! operands are expanded as assignments, so the value is neither field-split nor pathname-expanded.
//! `local x=$(echo a b)` binds `a b`; expanding it like an ordinary word bound `a` and passed `b`
//! as a separate argument, silently.
//!
//! That silence is why this has its own file. The bug it fixes was found in
//! `local command=${2/#"$widget"/__atuin_history --keymap-mode=emacs}`, where losing everything
//! after the first space left a shell integration computing keybindings that were all truncated to
//! their first word — with no diagnostic anywhere.

//! Process substitution: `<(cmd)` and `>(cmd)`.
//!
//! The command runs in a subshell connected to a pipe, and the *word* becomes the name of that
//! pipe — `/dev/fd/N` — so the program receiving it opens an ordinary file. That is what makes
//! `diff <(sort a) <(sort b)` work without either temporary file existing.
//!
//! Not POSIX, and deferred on that basis until the evidence said otherwise: of 740 real shell
//! scripts on a working system, 74 — one in ten — failed to parse in oslo, and every one of them
//! failed on this. "Not in POSIX" is the wrong test for a shell that intends to be the only one a
//! distribution has.
//!
//! Three things decide the design:
//!
//! * **The descriptor must outlive the expansion.** The word is built during expansion and used
//!   when the command runs, so closing the pipe at the end of expansion would hand the program a
//!   descriptor that is already gone. The shell holds them on `Environment` until the command
//!   that asked for them has finished, and `crate::exec::simple` closes them on every exit path.
//! * **The child must not inherit the descriptor it is named by.** A `<(cmd)` child holding the
//!   read end open means the reader never sees EOF, and `cat <(echo hi)` hangs forever.
//! * **`/dev/fd/N` is a Linux interface**, via `/proc/self/fd`. bash uses the same one here, and
//!   oslo is Linux-only, so there is no fallback path to maintain.

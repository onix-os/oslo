//! Word expansion.
//!
//! Split by expansion step so each stage owns one file: [`word`] runs the pipeline and defines the
//! quoting provenance every other stage consults, [`param`] resolves `${...}`, [`fields`] applies
//! IFS, [`glob`] applies pathname expansion, [`tilde`] resolves `~`.
//!
//! [`brace`] is the odd one out and does not run in that pipeline at all: it splits one word into
//! several *words* rather than fields, and it does so on the word's source text before the lexer
//! has seen it, which is where bash runs it and the only place the answer comes out the same. Its
//! callers are therefore the parser and the two places that lex a word list themselves, not
//! [`word::expand_word`].

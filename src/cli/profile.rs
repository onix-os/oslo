//! `oslo profile` — whose history this is, and how two machines agree about it.
//!
//! ```sh
//! oslo profile                       # every profile, marking the one this shell is using
//! oslo profile show [NAME]           # where its files are, and its fingerprint
//! oslo profile key init [NAME]       # give it a key, so it can be synced
//! oslo profile export [NAME]         # the key, to carry to the other machine
//! oslo profile import                # read one from standard input
//! oslo profile sync user@host        # two-way, over ssh
//! ```
//!
//! # Why a key at all
//!
//! `default` here and `default` on a box you have an account on are two histories that share a
//! word. Syncing them because the words match would merge somebody else's commands into yours, so
//! a profile carries a key and [`sync`] refuses unless both ends hold the same one. Carrying it
//! across once is the step that says *these two are one profile*.
//!
//! The key is in `$XDG_STATE_HOME`, never in the store — the store is the thing that travels.

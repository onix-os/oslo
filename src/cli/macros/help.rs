//! `oslo macros` help rendering.
//!
//! The same shape as `history`'s and `plugin`'s, to the letter: one `Sub` per subcommand, an
//! overview built from `row`, per-subcommand help behind `--help`, and notes wrapped to the
//! terminal. Three subcommand helps that read differently are three things to learn instead of one.

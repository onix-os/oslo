//! The builtin registry: the one table that decides what a builtin is.
//!
//! Three lists used to disagree — the `matches!` in `Environment::is_builtin`, a hardcoded
//! `match` in the dispatcher, and the map behind [`Environment::register_custom_builtin`] — so
//! a name could be a builtin to `type` and not to the dispatcher, or dispatch to a hardcoded
//! function while the map held a different one (PLAN R5.6, R9.8). Registration is now the only
//! way in: [`crate::env::builtins::register_default_builtins`] fills this table and
//! `is_builtin`, the dispatcher in [`crate::exec::simple`] and `type` all read it back. Adding a
//! builtin is one `register_custom_builtin` call and nothing else.

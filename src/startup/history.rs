//! Where the command history lives, how much of it is kept, and the `history` builtin
//! (PLAN R9.11).
//!
//! Three separate defects were behind this file. rustyline's default `max_history_size` is 100,
//! so a session silently forgot its 101st command; `history_ignore_space` was off, so the
//! ` password …` convention did nothing; and the whole file was rewritten on exit, so two
//! sessions open at once each ended with only their own commands.
//!
//! The `history` builtin has to read what the *line editor* holds, and `BuiltinFn` is a bare
//! `fn` pointer with nowhere to put a captured editor. So the REPL publishes a snapshot here
//! after every line, and the builtin reads that. The alternative — teaching the library about
//! the editor — would put rustyline in the dependency path of every `Environment`.

/// How many jobs `\j` in a `$PS1` reports.

/// background jobs would say anyway; when job tracking arrives this is the one place to change.

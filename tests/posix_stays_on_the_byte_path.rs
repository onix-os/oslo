//! oslo's structured pipeline is designed so a script written before oslo existed cannot reach it:
//! structure flows only between two stages that *both* declare they understand it, and every name
//! that can carry a declaration is either invented by oslo or a builtin deliberately declared as
//! bytes. See `docs/features/structured-pipelines.md`.
//!
//! That argument is worth only as much as its enforcement. This runs every script in the
//! differential corpus — the same corpus checked against bash byte for byte — with the shell
//! reporting how many structured edges it planned, and requires the answer to be zero every time.
//!
//! When that stops being true, this fails, and whoever made it stop has to say why.

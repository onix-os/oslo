//! The two hooks a bash prompt integration hangs off.
//!
//! `$PROMPT_COMMAND` runs before every prompt and `$RPS1` gives the right-hand side. Both are only
//! *drawn* by an interactive shell, so what a non-interactive test can pin is that they are
//! ordinary variables that expand like `PS1` and are not run by accident. The drawing was checked
//! against a live pty.
//!
//! This file replaced `bind_tests.rs`. `bind` was removed — around 875 lines so that interactive
//! plugins could claim a keystroke, in a shell whose first job is to be `/bin/sh`.

//! Where a diagnostic says it came from.
//!
//! A script that fails should name the file and the line, because that is the one thing the person
//! fixing it needs and the one thing every other shell already tells them. oslo prefixed every
//! diagnostic with `oslo: ` instead, so a failure two hundred lines into a script named the shell
//! and the command and nothing about *where*.
//!
//! The rule is bash's: a file gets `name: line N: `, and a prompt or a `-c` gets `oslo: ` — those
//! have no line worth naming, since every typed command is line one.

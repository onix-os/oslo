//! Differential suite: every corpus script, run through rush and through bash.
//!
//! The audit that produced PLAN.md found one dominant failure mode — a plausible *wrong answer*
//! with exit status 0. No self-referential test can see that class of bug, because the expected
//! output has to come from somewhere other than the implementation under test. So it comes from
//! bash, which is the specification every `/bin/sh` script was actually written against.
//!
//! What is compared, and why only this much:
//!
//! * **stdout** — byte for byte, after the scratch directory is rewritten to `<TMP>` so the two
//!   shells' private working directories do not show up as a difference.
//! * **exit status** — exactly, with a signal death recorded as `128 + signo` the way a shell
//!   reports one.
//! * **stderr shape** — empty versus non-empty, nothing more. Two different shells will never
//!   agree on diagnostic wording and should not be forced to; what matters is that a shell that
//!   should complain does, and a shell that should stay quiet does.
//!
//! Every case runs with stdin on `/dev/null`, in its own scratch directory, under a wall-clock
//! timeout. rush has live hangs (`while read` never terminates), and an unguarded suite would
//! wedge CI instead of failing it — so a timeout is a first-class verdict here, not an accident.
//!
//! Corpus scripts declare their oracle on the first line: `# mode: posix` runs `--posix -c` for
//! POSIX semantics, `# mode: bash` runs a plain `-c` for the bash extensions (arrays, `[[ ]]`,
//! `(( ))`, brace expansion) that rush also aims to support. The mode goes to **both** shells —
//! see [`compare`] for what it cost to get that wrong.

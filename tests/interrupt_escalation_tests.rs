//! Ctrl-C enough times takes the terminal back from a job that will not give it up.
//!
//! **A real pty, because there is nowhere else this exists.** The whole mechanism is about which
//! process group the terminal driver signals, and a pipe has no terminal driver — a test that drove
//! oslo through a pipe would be testing nothing at all.
//!
//! Each case runs a job that `trap`s `INT` away, so the ordinary interrupt provably does not end
//! it, and then counts keystrokes. The marker in the job's command line is unique per case so that
//! `pgrep` cannot see another case's leftovers.
//!
//! **The job is stopped, not killed**, so every case checks that the process is still there in
//! state `T` — that is what makes `fg`, `bg` and `kill %1` mean something afterwards, and it is the
//! difference between handing a decision back to the person and making it for them.

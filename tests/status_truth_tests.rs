//! Exit-status truthfulness in the cases the differential corpus cannot arbitrate.
//!
//! Two kinds of case live here rather than in `tests/corpus`:
//!
//! * **a child killed by a signal.** Reproducing one means having the victim kill its own parent
//!   (`kill -9 $PPID`), and which process that is depends on how many times the shell forked —
//!   bash execs the last stage of a pipeline in place and would kill *itself*. The number a shell
//!   must report is not in dispute (128 + signo), so it is asserted directly.
//! * **stdin.** Every corpus case runs with stdin on `/dev/null` precisely so a dropped
//!   redirection cannot hang the suite, which is also what makes it blind to a background job
//!   stealing the terminal's input.

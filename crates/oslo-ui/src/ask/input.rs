//! `ui input` — one line, typed.
//!
//! Inline rather than full-screen: the question and the answer stay in the scrollback where you
//! can scroll back and see what you agreed to. A picker that takes the whole screen and restores
//! it leaves nothing behind, which is right for browsing history and wrong for a question a script
//! asked you.
//!
//! # What it is not
//!
//! It is not the line editor. There is no completion, no history, no syntax colour, and the
//! editing keys stop at the ones people reach for without thinking: the arrows, Home and End,
//! backspace and forward delete, and Ctrl-U. A script asking for a branch name does not need
//! oslo's whole `readline`, and hosting it here would mean two things to keep in step for the rest
//! of the shell's life.

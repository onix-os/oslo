//! | | |
//! |---|---|
//! | ← → | the **tag**. Where the finder's scopes are, because both are "narrow this list" |
//! | Tab | the **source**. Where the finder's profile is, because both are "a different set" |
//! | Enter | the **editor** — for every kind, including an alias |
//! | Delete | forget it, behind the confirmation the finder already asks for |
//! | Space | off for this session |
//! | Space ×3 | off everywhere |
//!
//! Enter is the one that differs from the finder, and it has to: the finder puts a line on the
//! prompt because a past command is something to run again, while a macro is something you keep and
//! what you want from it is to change it.
//!
//! # It asks the caller to do things rather than doing them
//!
//! This module draws and dispatches. Forgetting a macro, turning one off and opening `$EDITOR` all
//! belong to whoever owns the database — see [`Backing`] — which is what keeps `oslo-ui` free of
//! both the store and the editor, and what lets the screen be tested by handing it a fake.

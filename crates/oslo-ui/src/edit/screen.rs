//! Turning a laid-out row into the escapes that put it on the terminal.
//!
//! Pure, like everything else here: [`redraw`] takes where the cursor is now and where the frame
//! wants it, and answers with a string. No terminal, so the sequences are asserted in tests rather
//! than discovered by watching a prompt march up the screen.
//!
//! # Every move is relative
//!
//! Never `ESC 7` / `ESC 8`. There is one cursor-save slot per terminal and the multiplexer hosting
//! the session shares it, so a restore lands wherever somebody else's save left the cursor. This
//! is the same rule [`crate::paint`] follows and for the same reason.
//!
//! # Why relative moves survive scrolling
//!
//! Writing a frame at the bottom of the screen makes the terminal scroll, so the row the prompt
//! started on moves up. Every position here is measured from *the cursor*, which the scroll moves
//! too — so the arithmetic stays true. An absolute row number would not.
//!
//! # The order of the erase
//!
//! `ESC [ J` erases from the cursor to the end of the screen, so it has to happen at the top-left
//! of the block **before** anything is drawn. Doing it after — at the end of the content — runs
//! into the pending wrap: on a row filled to the last column the cursor is still *in* that column,
//! and the erase would take back the character just written.

/// Where the frame wants the cursor, and how tall it is.

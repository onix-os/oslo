/// How a finished line leaves the screen.
///
/// Three ways, and the order they are tried in is the order of how much the caller asked for:
///
/// * `erase` — a key that *is* a command, which never wanted to be seen. See
///   [`crate::editor::Answer::erase`].
/// * `oslo.transcript.rule` — the prompt is replaced by the command between two rules. See
///   [`crate::settings::Transcript`].
/// * otherwise the line stays where it was typed and the next prompt goes under it, which is what
///   every shell has always done.
///
/// A blank line takes the plain ending whatever is configured: there is no command to frame, and a
/// pair of rules around an empty row is a worse transcript than none.
/// `None` when nothing replaces the block — the line stays where it was typed and the caller only
/// has to move past it. That distinction is the difference between a Ctrl-C that leaves one prompt
/// on screen and one that leaves two: a replacement has to be drawn over a repainted block, and a
/// repaint with nothing to replace it is simply the prompt written out a second time.

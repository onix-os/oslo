//! Computes the cell layout of an edited row.
//!
//! Given a prompt, the text, where the cursor is in it, a ghost hint and the terminal width:
//! how many rows the block occupies, and which row and column the cursor sits in. The caller
//! turns that into escapes with [`crate::paint`]'s discipline — reserve first, then
//! draw, never the shared save slot.
//!
//! # Cells, not characters
//!
//! A character is not a cell: `日` is two, a combining mark is none, and an emoji is two. Widths
//! come from [`crate::dropdown::display_width`], which already handles those and
//! skips SGR escapes — so a coloured prompt measures as what it prints.
//!
//! # The pending wrap
//!
//! A row filled exactly to the last column keeps a pending wrap. Row counts use
//! [`super::super::dropdown::physical_rows`] to preserve that state.

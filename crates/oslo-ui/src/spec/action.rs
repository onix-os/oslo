//! What one argument position completes to, and why it stays text until Tab.
//!
//! A carapace position is a list of strings, and each string is one of three things:
//!
//! ```yaml
//! positional:
//!   - ["dev", "staging\tthe shared one", "$files([.yaml])", "$prefix(env-)"]
//! ```
//!
//! a **literal** (value, description and a style oslo has no use for, tab-separated), a **macro**
//! that produces values, or a **modifier** that changes the values the entries before it produced.
//! A `` ||| `` inside one entry attaches modifiers to that entry alone.
//!
//! # Why it is not parsed once at load time
//!
//! Because a value may name a variable — `["$files([${C_FLAG_SUFFIX//,/, }])"]` — and the variables
//! are the flags and arguments of the line being typed. Substituting first and parsing after is the
//! order carapace uses, and it is the only order that lets `--suffix=.go` change what the next
//! position offers. Parsing is a handful of `split`s over a handful of short strings; the walk that
//! got here was the expensive part.
//!
//! # And why an [`Action`] can also be a function
//!
//! oslo has Lua. A string DSL exists in carapace because YAML has no functions, and there is no
//! reason for a config written in a real language to go through it — so `positional = { fn }` is a
//! first-class form rather than an escape hatch bolted on. The list form is what a *file* uses.

//! Keeping the prompt alive while something else runs.
//!
//! A command normally takes the screen with it: the editor has handed the line back, so the loop
//! that ticks an animated segment, services the background and repaints is gone until the command
//! ends. That is right almost always — a file browser drawn inline owns the terminal, and anything
//! oslo wrote over it would be damage.
//!
//! **Except when the command draws somewhere else.** A browser opened in a terminal mux's float
//! leaves oslo's own screen sitting there with a prompt on it, and that prompt then spends the whole
//! visit frozen: a spinner stops turning, and a directory the browser moves the shell to — over the
//! control socket, while you navigate — is not shown until you come back.
//!
//! So a command may be marked as not owning the terminal, and while it runs [`pump`] is called in
//! its wait loop. What it does is the editor's loop with the keyboard taken out: service the
//! background, re-render if that changed anything, redraw where the prompt is.
//!
//! # Why the renderer is a `fn` and not a closure
//!
//! Building a prompt means running Lua, which is `oslo-runtime`'s, and by the time a command is
//! waiting the closure the editor was given has been dropped. A plain function pointer can be
//! registered once for the session and reach the interpreter through the thread-local the runtime
//! already keeps for exactly this — hooks fire from places with no engine in hand the same way.

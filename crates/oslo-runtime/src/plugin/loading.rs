//! Which plugin's file is being loaded, while it is being loaded.
//!
//! # What it is for
//!
//! Two things ask *who is running this*: `oslo.plugin.test` attributes a registered test to the
//! plugin that registered it, and `oslo.secret` decides which store a handle may reach. Both need
//! the same answer and it is not one Lua can be trusted to supply — a plugin naming itself would be
//! a plugin naming somebody else.
//!
//! # What it is not
//!
//! **It is true while a plugin's file is being evaluated, and false everywhere else.** A hook
//! handler, a completion callback or a timer registered by a plugin runs later, with the slot
//! empty, and is indistinguishable from the same call made by a config or at the prompt. So this
//! answers *who acquired a handle*, which is attribution, and never *who is using one*, which
//! would be a sandbox. `docs/features/secrets.md` says so in those words.

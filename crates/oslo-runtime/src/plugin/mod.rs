//! Somebody else's Lua, found on the [runtimepath] and run at startup.
//!
//! # Loaded at startup, not by a stub
//!
//! The obvious design is a stub builtin per declared name, which loads the plugin when called. It
//! does not work, and the shell says so plainly:
//!
//! ```text
//! oslo: note: shell state is busy; an oslo.* call that reaches the shell cannot run from here.
//! ```
//!
//! A builtin runs *while the shell holds its state*, and `oslo.register_builtin` needs that state to
//! register anything — so a plugin loaded from inside a builtin can never register the builtin it
//! was loaded to provide. The stub is not a fixable design; it is the wrong place.
//!
//! So loading happens once, at startup, where the state is free.
//!
//! # What this replaced
//!
//! It used to be lazier: an index of every declared name, and a plugin loaded when a typed line
//! mentioned one of its words. That bought a startup measured in hundreds of microseconds, and cost
//! a manifest, a generated index, a trust ledger, and one wart nobody could explain — `type note`
//! before `note` had ever been typed reported it as not found, because the plugin providing it had
//! not run.
//!
//! Loading everything costs a few milliseconds on a shell that starts in under one, and the wart is
//! gone: every plugin's commands exist at the first prompt.
//!
//! # What loads plugins
//!
//! Only the interactive shell. `oslo -c` and a script never read `init.lua` and never walk the path
//! either: a plugin extends the shell you type at, and a script that depended on one would break for
//! anybody who had not installed it.
//!
//! [runtimepath]: crate::runtimepath

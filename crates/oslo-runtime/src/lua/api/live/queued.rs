//! What a connected peer asked the shell to *do*, waiting for the thread that may do it.
//!
//! Reading is answered where the question arrives: [`super::super::live`]'s verbs take the
//! environment lock on the server thread and reply. Changing the shell cannot be, and the reason is
//! not the lock.
//!
//! # Why a queue and not just a `chdir`
//!
//! `set_current_dir` is **process-wide**. A server thread calling it moves the ground under every
//! other thread in the shell, including one that is part-way through resolving a relative path for
//! an `exec`. This codebase has already paid for that lesson somewhere quieter — `tests/common`
//! records three flaky tests caused by exactly this — and a shell is a far worse place to learn it
//! again: the failure is a command that runs in the wrong directory, occasionally.
//!
//! So the server thread records what was asked and wakes the shell, and the shell does it at the
//! same safe point it reaps children and fires timers at: on its own thread, between keystrokes,
//! holding nothing. [`oslo_base::background`] already owns that machinery, and this only registers
//! one more descriptor with it.
//!
//! # What the peer is told
//!
//! That it was **accepted**, not that it happened — because at the moment of the reply it has not.
//! A shell running a foreground command gets there when the command ends. Claiming otherwise would
//! be a lie that a caller could act on, and the honest answer costs nothing to give.

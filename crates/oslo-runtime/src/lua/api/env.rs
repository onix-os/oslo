//! `oslo.env` — shell and environment variables.
//!
//! A file of its own, like every other namespace, and it was the last one without one: these lived
//! inline in [`super`] while `oslo.fs`, `oslo.path`, `oslo.re` and the rest each had a module. The
//! split is not tidying — `mod.rs` had reached 596 of the 600 lines `scripts/check-loc.sh` allows,
//! so every namespace that wanted a line there was blocked behind this one.
//!
//! # These take the lock, and that is the whole distinction
//!
//! Everything here goes through [`borrow_env`], so everything here raises *shell state is busy*
//! inside a registered builtin or an answering hook. That is not true of most of `oslo.*` — the
//! lock is 28 functions across six files, not the whole API — and the difference is worth knowing
//! before reaching for a workaround. See `docs/features/your-own-tools.md`.

//! What a builtin returns when it wants to change something.
//!
//! ```lua
//! oslo.register_builtin{ name = "use", run = function(argv, shell)
//!   return { status = 0, export = { PROFILE = argv[2] }, cd = "/srv/" .. argv[2] }
//! end }
//! ```
//!
//! # Why a returned table rather than calls
//!
//! A builtin runs while the shell holds its own state, so `oslo.env.set` inside one raises and a
//! plain `X = "1"` is a `try_lock` that **silently drops the write**. The frame above holds a live
//! `&mut Environment`; the honest shape is therefore to *tell* it rather than to ask, which turns a
//! wall into a question about write ordering.
//!
//! # Parse is total, and separate from apply
//!
//! [`parse`] touches no `Environment` and rejects everything it does not understand — an unknown
//! key, a wrong type, a `cd` where one is not allowed — so a malformed return applies **nothing**.
//! An effect that is well-formed and *refused at runtime* (a readonly variable) is different, and
//! is reported by the shell's own machinery rather than a second time here.

//! The command line a hook is about to see, as data rather than as a string.
//!
//! `pre-cmd` used to hand over `text` and nothing else, so a config that wanted to know what was
//! being run had to split it itself — and splitting a shell line with `gmatch("%S+")` is wrong the
//! moment somebody types `cat 'a b'`, `echo $HOME` or `a | b`. The shell parses the line a moment
//! later anyway; this hands the config the same answer instead of making it guess.
//!
//! # The shape
//!
//! A **flat list of the simple commands, in the order they were written**, each saying how it joins
//! the one before:
//!
//! ```lua
//! oslo.on.pre_cmd(function(c)
//!   #c.commands              -- how many commands the line runs
//!   c.commands[1].argv[1]    -- the first word of the first command
//!   c.commands[2].link       -- "|", "&&", "||", ";" or "&"
//! end)
//! ```
//!
//! Flat rather than nested, because the questions people ask are flat: *how many commands*, *what
//! is the second one*, *is anything piped*. A tree of lists of pipelines of commands answers those
//! only after the caller has walked it, and every caller would walk it the same way. The nesting is
//! not lost — it is in `link`, which is exactly the part of the tree that carries meaning.
//!
//! # What a word says
//!
//! Quoting is resolved and expansion is not, because expansion has not happened yet and inventing
//! an answer would be a lie: `cat 'a b'` gives one word `a b`, and `cat $HOME` gives the word
//! `$HOME`. A config testing `argv[2]` against the filesystem gets the path when it is written
//! plainly, and something it can see is a variable when it is not.

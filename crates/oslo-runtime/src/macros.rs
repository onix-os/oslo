//! Opening the macro manager, from wherever it was asked for.
//!
//! Two things ask: `oslo macros show`, and the key bound to `oslo.macros.key` at the prompt. They
//! want the same screen over the same database, so the screen lives here rather than in either —
//! `oslo-ui` owns the drawing and the keys, `oslo-base` owns the store, and this is the short piece
//! that hands one to the other.
//!
//! # The screen closes to edit, and comes back
//!
//! Enter opens `$EDITOR`, which wants the alternate screen and the terminal's own modes. So the
//! manager exits, the editor runs, and the manager reopens with the query it had. Holding a
//! full-screen widget open around a child that also drives the terminal is how two programs end up
//! fighting over one termios.

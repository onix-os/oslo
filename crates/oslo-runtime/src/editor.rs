//! Handing a piece of text to the editor the user already uses, and taking it back.
//!
//! oslo had no editor integration at all before this — nothing shelled out to one — so this is the
//! whole of it, and it is deliberately small.
//!
//! # Which editor
//!
//! `$VISUAL`, then `$EDITOR`, then `nvim`, then `vi`. In that order and no other: the two variables
//! are what a person has already told every other program, and a shell that ignored them to launch
//! its own favourite would be the one program on the machine that did.
//!
//! `vi` is last because POSIX says it is there. `nvim` is ahead of it because somebody who has
//! neither variable set and does have `nvim` installed did not install it by accident.
//!
//! # The extension is not decoration
//!
//! The temporary file is named for the language it holds — `.sh`, `.lua`, `.py` — because syntax
//! highlighting is most of the reason to want a real editor rather than a prompt. An editor opening
//! on `tmpXXXX` with no extension colours nothing.
//!
//! # Unchanged is not a write
//!
//! Opening an editor and closing it without saving stores nothing and says so. The alternative —
//! rewriting the row with identical bytes — is indistinguishable from a change to anything watching,
//! and "unchanged" is the answer the user is expecting to see.

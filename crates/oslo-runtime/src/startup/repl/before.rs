//! Everything the shell does between one command ending and the next prompt being drawn.
//!
//! Six phases, and what they have in common is that none of them is about the line you are about
//! to type: they reconcile the session with whatever changed while it was busy. The directory it
//! is standing in, the macros another window edited, the universal variables another window set,
//! what this shell publishes about itself, and the two hooks a prompt integration hangs off.
//!
//! **They are here rather than in the loop because they are one thing.** Each is cheap when nothing
//! has changed — a comparison, two `stat`s, one `stat`, a relaxed load — and the reason they can
//! afford to run before *every* prompt is that the common answer is "nothing to do". Read together
//! that is obvious; read spread through the loop it looks like six unrelated costs.

//! What the interactive loop already knows, handed to the store instead of dropped on the floor.
//!
//! One turn of [`super::repl`] computes the directory the command started in, the moment it
//! started, the directory it left the shell in, how long it took and what it exited with — all
//! within sixty lines — and then keeps two of them. Nothing here is new telemetry; it is those
//! same locals reaching a table. The whole of it is one call at the end of the loop.
//!
//! # Why not the `postcmd` hook
//!
//! Because that hook fires only on `Ok(status)`, so every command that failed outright would go
//! unrecorded — and failures are exactly what the `fails` column exists to hold. This runs beside
//! the hook, not through it.
//!
//! # Why the store is opened here and nowhere else
//!
//! [`crate::startup`] is the binary. A script, an `oslo -c` or a subshell never reaches this file,
//! so `track::store()` answers `None` for them and there is no file for a CI job's command lines to
//! land in — a structural answer rather than a flag somebody has to remember to check.

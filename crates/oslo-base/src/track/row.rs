//! The schema: what a directory is, what a line run in it is, and every key that reaches one.
//!
//! Under SQL this was `CREATE TABLE` and a handful of `CREATE INDEX`. It is one module here for the
//! same reason the DDL was one constant — a key built in two places is a key that will one day be
//! built two ways, and the symptom of that is a range scan that quietly returns nothing.
//!
//! # Rows are tuples, so they are encoded like keys
//!
//! [`super::kv::Key`] and [`super::kv::Fields`] do the values as well as the keys. That is the
//! seam's instruction and it is the right one: `run`'s five counters are a tuple exactly as
//! `(dir_id, mode, argv)` is, the framing is self-delimiting either way, and a second encoder would
//! be a second thing to get wrong. What is wasted on a value is the ordering guarantee, which costs
//! nothing.
//!
//! Fixed-width fields come first in every row and the text last. A value that has been truncated or
//! was written by something else then fails in the integers, before anything has been allocated for
//! a string that was never there.
//!
//! # Two nulls, and how each is spelled
//!
//! SQL had `NULL`; this has sentinels, one per column, each chosen so that no real value can
//! collide with it.
//!
//! * `dir.root` and `dir.missing_since`, `run.last_status` — [`NEVER`] is `i64::MIN`, which is not
//!   an epoch second, not a dwell time and not an exit status. `waitpid` reports a status in
//!   `0..=255` and a signal death as a small negative, so the bottom of the range is free.
//! * `dir.root` is text, and a git toplevel is an absolute path — never the empty string. So an
//!   empty `root` field is "outside a repository", which is also what it decodes back to.
//!
//! # The five buckets this module writes into
//!
//! | bucket | key | value | what it answers |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `Dir` | `dir_id` | [`DirRow`] | the row itself |
//! | `DirByPath` | `path` | `dir_id` | "which directory am I standing in" |
//! | `DirByBase` | `(base, dir_id)` | — | `cd rust`, as a range over the folded final component |
//! | `DirByRoot` | `(root, dir_id)` | — | every directory of one worktree |
//! | `Run` | `(dir_id, mode, argv)` | [`RunRow`] | the aggregate, and the suggestion range |
//! | `RunByArgv` | `(mode, argv, dir_id)` | — | the same question with no directory to pin it |
//!
//! The two index buckets carry no value at all. Everything they would hold is already in the key,
//! and a byte written per index entry per command is a byte the 8 MiB growth step eventually
//! charges for.

//! The rule that decides which copy of a thing wins, written once for everything that syncs.
//!
//! # Why a stamp rather than a timestamp
//!
//! Two machines that sync have no shared clock, and the one whose clock is wrong would win every
//! conflict for as long as it stayed wrong. So nothing here asks when something happened. Each copy
//! carries a *revision* that only goes up, and the higher one is the newer one by definition.
//!
//! # The three fields, in the order they are consulted
//!
//! 1. **`revision`** — every change bumps it, so a copy that has been edited beats one that has not.
//! 2. **`deleted`** — a tie goes to the deleted one. Deletion wins ties on purpose: the alternative
//!    is a thing you removed coming back, which is the failure people actually notice.
//! 3. **`tie_breaker`** — sixteen random bytes, *stored with the record* and rerolled on every
//!    change. Two machines that edited the same thing to the same revision have to agree on which
//!    edit survives, and the only way to agree without talking is to compare something both of them
//!    already hold.
//!
//! # Why this makes sync order-independent
//!
//! Both ends run this comparison over the same two records and reach the same answer without
//! negotiating. So it does not matter which machine starts the sync, nor how many times it runs:
//! merging is idempotent, and running it backwards gives the same result as running it forwards.
//!
//! # What a tombstone is for
//!
//! A record that is deleted stays, with `deleted` set and its revision bumped. Removing the row
//! outright would be indistinguishable from never having had it — and the other end, seeing a
//! record we lack, would helpfully give it back on the next sync. The tombstone is what says *I
//! know about this one, and it is gone.*

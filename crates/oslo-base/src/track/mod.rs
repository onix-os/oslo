//! What the shell learns from being used: where you work, and what you run there.
//!
//! oslo's REPL loop already computes everything this store holds — the line, its language, whether
//! it was secret, the directory before and after, the wall-clock duration and the exit status — and
//! then discards all but the line and the language. This is not new telemetry; it is the same
//! sixty lines of `repl.rs` not throwing their inputs away. What it buys is a `cd` that can find a
//! directory by name and a suggestion that knows `cargo run --example` meant something different in
//! the last project.
//!
//! # It is an aggregate, not a log
//!
//! The `.db` of the same profile is already the event log, one row per line typed. A second log
//! would double the
//! write cost and double the privacy surface for a chronology that already exists — and the store
//! underneath has no `VACUUM`, so a file that grows is a permanent high-water mark. That argument
//! got sharper rather than weaker when the engine changed: Tagdata grows in one 8 MiB step and
//! never gives it back, so the aggregate and the bounds in [`prune`] are what stand between oslo
//! and 8.5 MiB for ever. An aggregate is bounded by distinct *behaviour* rather than by time:
//! repeats, which are the entire point of the ranking, cost nothing after the first. What it gives
//! up is the order of individual executions, which is recoverable by joining the event log if
//! anything ever needs it.
//!
//! # Why it lives in the library
//!
//! `src/startup/` is private to the binary (`main.rs` declares `mod startup;`), and `builtin_cd` is
//! library code that has to be able to ask this store where to jump. So it is here, and the handle
//! is a process-global installed by the interactive loop and by nothing else.
//!
//! That is the privacy design as much as the plumbing one. A script, an `oslo -c`, or a subshell
//! never calls [`install`], so [`store`] answers `None` and every clever path is *structurally*
//! unreachable rather than gated by a flag someone has to remember to check. A CI job's command
//! lines cannot reach the file because there is no file to reach.

//! Whose history this is.
//!
//! The store is named after a **profile** rather than after what it contains: `default.kv`, not
//! `history.db` or `track.kv`.
//!
//! # Why a name at all
//!
//! Because more than one thing runs commands through this shell. An agent that shells out — and
//! they all do — writes thousands of lines into the same history a person is trying to search, and
//! into the same frecency table that decides what `cd` and Tab suggest. `oslo --profile=claude` gives it
//! its own store: its history is still recorded, still searchable by pointing another
//! shell at the same profile, and no longer mixed into yours.
//!
//! It is a *profile*, not a lock. Nothing stops two shells sharing one, which is what makes
//! `oslo --profile=claude` twice in a row accumulate rather than start over.
//!
//! A profile also carries a **key**, in [`key`]: the thing that says two machines mean the same
//! history rather than two histories that share a word. Nothing needs it until `oslo profile sync`
//! does.
//!
//! Either `--profile=NAME` or `$OSLO_PROFILE` names it — the flag for one invocation, the variable
//! for a whole session, and the flag wins when both are given.

//! Tilde expansion — `~`, `~user`, `~+` and `~-`.
//!
//! **Here rather than in the shell because four callers need it and three of them are the prompt.**
//! The shell expands `~root/bin` and `~+/src` exactly as bash does; completion, the ghost suggestion
//! and the highlighter each knew only `~` and `~/…`, so `ls ~+/` offered nothing, `~root` never lit
//! as a path that is there, and a form the shell understands perfectly read at the prompt as a
//! mistake. One expander answering all four is the only arrangement in which they cannot disagree.
//!
//! Every failure path returns the text unchanged, which is what POSIX asks for and also the only
//! safe answer: `~nosuchuser` as a literal is a path that will fail loudly, while a guessed home
//! directory is a path that will succeed on the wrong files.

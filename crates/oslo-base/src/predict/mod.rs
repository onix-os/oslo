//! What you are about to type, and what you meant by what failed.
//!
//! A [`vista::Predictor`] fed from the command history this crate already keeps. Two questions,
//! one model: *what comes next* (a suggestion source) and *what did you mean* (repair, the thing
//! `thefuck` does with two hundred hand-written rules and this does with none).
//!
//! # Why this lives beside the history rather than above it
//!
//! Every field the model wants is already recorded — the line, which shell typed it, where in that
//! shell's run it came, and how it turned out. Nothing new is written to make prediction work; see
//! [`Model::learn`] for the mapping. Putting the model anywhere else would mean carrying that data
//! up a layer to meet it.
//!
//! # What the model is told, and what it is not
//!
//! * **The session is the stream.** Ordering only means something within one shell: the command
//!   you ran here after `cargo build` says nothing about what somebody's other terminal did in
//!   between. `Entry::session` is already exactly this.
//! * **A stream orders candidates; it does not fence them.** Measured, not assumed: a command from
//!   another terminal *is* offered here, because the recent cache is global — and it ranks below
//!   what this shell actually does, by a wide margin once there is any pattern to go on. That is
//!   the right behaviour for a shell (the history source has always offered other shells' lines)
//!   but it is not what "the session is the stream" would lead you to expect, so it is written
//!   down and pinned by a test.
//! * **A secret command leaves no gap, and that is a known hole.** `seq` is advanced only when a
//!   row is appended, so a line you hid consumes no position and the model sees the commands either
//!   side of it as consecutive — learning a transition that never occurred. The comment here used
//!   to claim the counter skipped; it does not. See [`crate::track::log::Entry::seq`].
//! * **A secret line is not learned**, because it was never recorded to begin with. That is a
//!   property of the log rather than a rule here, which is the strongest form it could take.
//! * **Only a command that worked is learned.** See `succeeded` below: a mistyped line inside the model
//!   is a command like any other, and repair for it goes silent — which is fatal for the case the
//!   feature exists for, since you ask after the failure rather than before it.

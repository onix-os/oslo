//! The small named things you accumulate: aliases, abbreviations, functions and scripts.
//!
//! ```text
//! ~/.local/share/oslo/macros/macros.db         the four kinds, keyed `<kind>/<name>`
//! ~/.local/share/oslo/macros/macros.snapshot   what a starting shell actually reads
//! ```
//!
//! # One store, not one per profile
//!
//! History is per profile because an agent's commands must not pollute the ranking of yours.
//! Aliases are the opposite: they are *your tooling*, and adding one in this shell and not finding
//! it in the next is the whole of the surprise. A profile changes what the shell **remembers**, not
//! what it **knows how to do**.
//!
//! # Why there is a snapshot as well as a database
//!
//! Measured, because the answer decided the design:
//!
//! ```text
//! oslo -c true, static musl            842 µs      (dash: 622 µs)
//! opening this database                2.61 ms     three times a whole shell start
//! reading 60 rows out of it            1.13 ms
//! reading 60 aliases from a flat file  3.6 µs
//! ```
//!
//! An interactive shell already pays 2.6 ms for the tracking store; a second one would double that
//! to answer a question a `read(2)` answers in microseconds. So [`snapshot::write`] is called by
//! every mutation and [`snapshot::read`] is what a starting shell reads.
//!
//! **The database stays the single source of truth.** The snapshot is a cache: delete it and the
//! next `oslo macros` command writes it again, and a shell that finds none simply has no aliases
//! until then rather than reading a database on the startup path.
//!
//! # Only two kinds are in the snapshot
//!
//! An alias must be in hand before the first line is parsed, and an abbreviation before the first
//! keystroke. A function or a script is looked up **after** the `$PATH` search has already failed —
//! the rule `exec::simple::autoload` states — so it costs a database open only on a line that was
//! going to fail anyway, and nothing at startup.

//! Merging two macro stores, both ways at once.
//!
//! # The same rule as history, on a different shape
//!
//! History merges *events*, which are immutable and identified by a random id. Macros are the
//! opposite: mutable records identified by something a person chose, `alias/gs`. So there is no
//! merge of two histories to do here — for any one name, one of the two copies wins outright, and
//! [`crate::track::stamp`] is what picks it.
//!
//! That the rule lives elsewhere is the whole point: history, macros and secrets each keep their
//! own storage and their own encoding, and share the one definition of *newer*.
//!
//! # Why both sides are written
//!
//! A sync that only pulled would leave the far end missing everything this machine has, and the
//! person would have to remember to run it again from over there. Both stores come out holding the
//! union, so it does not matter which end you type it on.

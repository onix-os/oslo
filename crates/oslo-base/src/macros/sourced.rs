//! The aliases, written as a file another shell can source.
//!
//! ```sh
//! # in ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
//! [ -f ~/.local/share/oslo/macros/macros.sh ] && . ~/.local/share/oslo/macros/macros.sh
//! ```
//!
//! # The half that a `$PATH` directory cannot carry
//!
//! [`super::bin`] answers "how does bash *run* a stored script" — a file on `$PATH`. It cannot
//! answer the same question for an alias, because an alias is not a program: it has to be *defined
//! inside* the shell that will use it, which means a file that shell sources. That is exactly what
//! `~/.config/profile/aliases.sh` was before any of this, so this is the same file with the database
//! as its source instead of an editor.
//!
//! Derived, like everything else here: rewritten by every mutation, never edited, safe to delete.
//!
//! # What is in it, and what cannot be
//!
//! Aliases, and functions whose bodies are shell. **Not abbreviations** — an abbreviation is expanded
//! into the line as you type it, by the line editor, and there is nothing for bash to be told. **Not
//! a function written in Lua**, for the same reason in a different direction: bash has no Lua.
//!
//! And not scripts, which are files in [`super::bin`] and would be a second copy here.

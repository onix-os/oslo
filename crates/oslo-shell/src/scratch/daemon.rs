//! One process in front of every scratch, for `oslo.scratch.daemon = true`.
//!
//! ```text
//!   client ──► daemon.sock   0x10                    which scratches are there?
//!                            0x11 len(u16be) name…   put me in this one
//!
//!   after an attach the connection is a pipe: whatever the scratch says, and whatever is typed at it,
//!   spliced byte for byte. The daemon reads none of it.
//! ```
//!
//! # What it is for, given the other backend works
//!
//! One socket instead of one per scratch, and one process that knows the whole list without reading a
//! directory. That is the whole difference, and it is why this is a registry and a splice rather
//! than a second implementation of everything: the keeper below is the same keeper.
//!
//! # Started on demand, never installed
//!
//! There is no service to enable. The first client that needs a daemon forks one, exactly as a
//! client forks a keeper without one — so a machine with no scratches has no oslo process running, which
//! is the property that makes this safe to have on by default for anybody who wants it.

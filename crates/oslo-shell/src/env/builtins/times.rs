//! `times` — accumulated user and system time for the shell and its children.
//!
//! Two lines, `user system`: the shell's own times first, its waited-for children's second.
//!
//! The numbers come from `getrusage(2)`, which is what `times(2)` is built on. They used to come
//! from `/proc/self/stat`, parsed by hand, because `nix` only exposes the call behind a feature
//! this crate did not enable — `ulimit` turned that feature on, so the reason for the workaround
//! outlived the workaround itself.

//! [`builtin_cd`] is a ladder, and the order of its rungs is the whole safety argument. Options,
//! arity, `$HOME`, `$OLDPWD` and the directory ring are settled first and answer directly; then the
//! operand is tried as what it says it is, against the filesystem, through `CDPATH`. Only when that
//! has already failed is a remembered directory of that name considered, in [`super::jump`], and
//! only in a shell that has a store. So every POSIX case is decided before anything clever exists,
//! and the clever part can only ever turn an error into a success — never a success into a surprise.

//! `whereis` — the files a name has, plus the answer only the shell knows.
//!
//! Where [`super`]'s `which` answers "what would run?", this answers "what is on disk under this
//! name?", and the two are different questions the moment a name is a builtin: `whereis cd` from
//! `/usr/bin/whereis` prints `cd:` and stops, which is true about the filesystem and useless about
//! the shell you typed it into.
//!
//! ```text
//! ls   → ls: /usr/bin/ls /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz
//! cd   → cd: shell built-in command
//! me   → me: stored script
//! ```
//!
//! **One entry per thing, not per file.** `oslo macros` writes a copy of every stored script into
//! its own directory for the benefit of everything that is not oslo, and that copy is left out here
//! exactly as it is in `which` and `type`: it is the same macro written down twice, and a line
//! reading `me: stored script /home/…/sbin/me` says the name means two things when it means one.
//! Where `me` is, is the database. The file is derived from it and rewritten whenever it changes.
//!
//! # What is not searched
//!
//! Sources. `whereis -s` looks through a compiled-in list of source directories that means
//! something on a machine that keeps its ports tree in `/usr/src` and nothing on one that does not.
//! Inventing a list here would produce confident wrong answers, so `-s` is refused rather than
//! answered badly.

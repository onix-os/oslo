//! `which` and `whereis` — builtins, because the programs by those names cannot see a shell.
//!
//! # Why they are not left to `/usr/bin/which`
//!
//! `which` is a program that reads `$PATH`, and everything interesting about a name in oslo is
//! invisible to a program: an alias lives in this shell's memory, a builtin has no file at all, and
//! a stored macro is a row in a database that dispatch reaches *after* `$PATH`. So the honest
//! answer to `which ll` is one only the shell can give, and `/usr/bin/which` answers "nothing" —
//! not because nothing runs, but because it was asked by something that cannot see.
//!
//! zsh has had `which` as a builtin for this reason for thirty years; bash has `type` and leaves
//! `which` wrong. This is the zsh answer, in zsh's wording:
//!
//! ```text
//! ls        → /usr/bin/ls
//! ll        → ll: aliased to ls -alF
//! cd        → cd: shell built-in command
//! me        → me: stored script
//! if        → if: shell reserved word
//! ```
//!
//! A path is printed bare, because a bare path is what every `$(which foo)` in the world expects.
//! Anything that is *not* a file is `name: what it is`, which no script can mistake for a path.
//!
//! **The real program is still there**, at `/usr/bin/which`, for a script that wants a `$PATH`
//! search and nothing else — as is `which --skip-alias`, which does the same thing from here.
//!
//! # The one dispatch table
//!
//! Neither of these knows the resolution order. They ask [`control::ways`], which is what `type`
//! prints and what `command -v` agrees with; a `which` that disagreed with dispatch would be worse
//! than the one that was wrong for a visible reason.

//! Variables whose value is read at the moment they are expanded.
//!
//! `$EPOCHREALTIME` is not a variable anybody set; it is the clock, spelled as a variable. So it
//! cannot live in the variable table — it has to be computed on each expansion, which is what this
//! module is for.
//!
//! # Why a shell needs these at all
//!
//! Because every prompt tool measures how long your last command took, and the only portable way
//! to do that is to read a high-resolution clock twice: once in preexec, once in precmd. Without
//! `$EPOCHREALTIME`, starship shells out to `starship time`, oh-my-posh to `oh-my-posh get millis`
//! and hexe to `date +%s%3N` — **a process fork per command, on the path between pressing Enter and
//! seeing a prompt.** That is the whole cost of not having a two-line feature.
//!
//! `$SECONDS` is deliberately here too, and deliberately useless for that purpose: bash specifies
//! it at one-second resolution, so it measures nothing a person would notice. It exists because
//! scripts use it for coarse timeouts.
//!
//! # An assignment wins
//!
//! Every name here is overridable. `SECONDS=0` is an idiom — it resets the count — and a script
//! that says `RANDOM=42` is asking for a reproducible sequence. So the table is consulted only
//! when the variable has not been set, which also means none of these can shadow something a
//! parent process exported.

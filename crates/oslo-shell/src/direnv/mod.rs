//! Directory environments: one `.env.lua` per project.
//!
//! `direnv`, built in. See `docs/research/direnv.md` for what was read and what was deliberately not
//! copied; the short version is that most of direnv's machinery exists because it is an external
//! binary talking to a shell it did not write, and oslo *is* the shell. There is no bash subprocess,
//! no prompt hook and no `eval` protocol: the state lives in memory and the load happens on the
//! `cd` path.
//!
//! **One name, and it is oslo's own.** `.env.lua`, in the language the rest of the configuration is
//! written in.
//!
//! `.envrc` was read too, for a while, against a reimplementation of direnv's stdlib — 1100 lines
//! of Rust tracking 1.4k lines of someone else's bash so that `use flake` and `layout python` meant
//! here what they mean there. Every one of those is a place for the two to disagree in a way only a
//! user hits, and none of it is work oslo has to do: direnv exists, it is on the machine, and it is
//! good at this.
//!
//! So an `.envrc` project runs direnv, from one line in `init.lua`:
//!
//! ```lua
//! oslo.env.set("PROMPT_COMMAND", 'eval "$(direnv export bash)"')
//! ```
//!
//! `$PROMPT_COMMAND` is evaluated against the live environment before every prompt, which is what
//! direnv's own bash hook is built on — load *and* unload, with no oslo code in the middle. Pair it
//! with `oslo.command.when` and `oslo.feature.when` and each tool takes the directories that are
//! its own.
//!
//! Two things *are* copied, because neither is incidental to being an external binary:
//!
//! * **the allow gate.** A file in a directory getting to run code when you walk in is arbitrary
//!   code execution by anyone who can get you to clone a repository, and [`allow`] is the answer,
//!   hash for hash;
//! * **the undo record in the environment**, direnv's `DIRENV_DIFF`. This one was skipped at first,
//!   on the reasoning above, and skipping it was wrong — see [`carry`]. The variables have to go
//!   into the real `environ` for a child to see them at all, so every child inherits them; without
//!   a record travelling alongside, a child holds one project's `$PATH` in every directory it ever
//!   visits and has nothing to put back.
//!
//! # The lifecycle
//!
//! On a directory change, and only on a directory change:
//!
//! 1. find the nearest ancestor with rc files;
//! 2. if it is the same set, unchanged, do nothing — the common case, and it costs one `stat` each;
//! 3. otherwise **unload first**, always, so moving between two projects cannot leave the first
//!    one's variables behind;
//! 4. then load the new one, if it is allowed.
//!
//! A shell that inherited an environment starts at step 3 with the record its parent left, which is
//! how it comes to be holding something it never loaded and can still give it back.

//! What `argc` asks the world, answered by this shell.
//!
//! `argc::Runtime` is how the parser reaches outside itself: the environment, `$PATH`, the
//! filesystem, and one method that runs a *script's own functions* to compute a default or a list of
//! choices. Upstream's implementation answers the last one by starting bash.
//!
//! # This one does not start anything
//!
//! ```text
//! # @option --dir=`_default_dir`     a default computed by a function
//! # @arg host[`_choice_host`]        completions computed by a function
//! ```
//!
//! Upstream runs those by exec'ing `bash script.sh ___internal___ _default_dir …` and reading its
//! stdout. oslo is a shell: it has the script's source, a parser and an evaluator, so it runs the
//! function **in a subshell of this process** and captures the output the way `$(…)` does. That is
//! faster, needs no bash on the machine, and works for a script that has no file at all — which the
//! macro store is full of, since a stored script is executed from memory and its `$0` is its name
//! rather than a path.
//!
//! # Everything else is what the shell already knows
//!
//! `env_var` is this shell's variables, not the process environment: a variable set by the script
//! and not exported is still a variable the script can see, and `argc` asking about one has to get
//! the same answer the script would.

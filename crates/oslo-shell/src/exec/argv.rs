//! Running a command from an argv list, with output optionally captured.
//!
//! This is what Lua's `oslo.run{…}` and `sh.grep(…)` reach, and it is deliberately *not* a second
//! executor: it hands the list to [`crate::exec::simple::run_argv`], which is the same command
//! search the shell itself uses. What lives here is only the part the shell expresses with syntax
//! instead — whether output is captured, and what the result looks like afterwards.
//!
//! Capture is opt-in. A shell that buffered every command's output by default would hold all of
//! `cargo build` in memory to answer a question nobody asked; running with output going straight
//! to the terminal is both the common case and the cheap one.

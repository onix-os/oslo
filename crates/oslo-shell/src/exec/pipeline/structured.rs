//! Choosing between the byte pipeline and the structured one.
//!
//! Every pipeline oslo has ever run goes through the byte path: one process per stage, bytes on
//! every descriptor. This module answers one question before that happens — *does any edge of this
//! pipeline carry structured rows instead* — and it answers "no" for every pipeline written before
//! oslo invented a vocabulary for saying otherwise.
//!
//! Kept apart from the pipeline itself so the byte path stays exactly as long and exactly as
//! readable as it was, and so the seam between the two is one function rather than a condition
//! threaded through the old code. See `docs/features/structured-pipelines.md`.

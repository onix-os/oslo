//! Running a pipeline whose stages read each other by coordinate.
//!
//! ```text
//! cat hosts.txt | ssh {0:0} uptime
//! ```
//!
//! `ssh`'s command line is not known until `cat` has produced a line, so the two cannot run at
//! once. This path runs the stages **one at a time**, keeping what each printed, and rewrites the
//! next stage's words from it before starting it.
//!
//! # Nothing else pays for it
//!
//! [`super::run_stages`] asks [`uses_coordinates`] before any stage runs, and a pipeline that says
//! no goes down the concurrent path it always did. The question is a scan of the literal words for
//! a `{` followed by a digit — no allocation, no capture, nothing kept.
//!
//! # Why the last stage is not captured
//!
//! A captured stage writes to a pipe, and every stage but the last **already** writes to a pipe:
//! standing between them costs nothing, changes no descriptor's nature and is invisible. The last
//! stage writes to the terminal, and interposing there would turn `isatty` false — colours off,
//! pagers not paging, progress bars silent — which is the whole reason `keep` exists as an opt-in
//! rather than a default. So the last stage runs exactly as it always has.
//!
//! That is also why a coordinate reaching *back past this pipeline* is not here yet: it needs the
//! previous command's output, and the previous command was somebody's last stage.
//!
//! # A stage is fed from a file, not a pipe
//!
//! The captured text goes into a temporary file which becomes the next stage's stdin. A pipe would
//! deadlock: the parent cannot write a megabyte into one while the child it is writing to has not
//! started reading, and the child cannot start until the parent stops writing. `tempfile` is a
//! dependency of this crate for the same reason in `direnv`, where the comment says so.

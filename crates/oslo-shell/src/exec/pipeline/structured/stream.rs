//! A structured pipeline whose upstream has no end.
//!
//! ```text
//! tail -f app.log | lines | where 'line:match("ERROR")'
//! yes             | lines | first 2
//! ```
//!
//! # What was wrong
//!
//! Everything in the structured half materialises. [`super::capture`] reads the byte prefix **to
//! end of file** into a `String` before the first verb runs, so a pipeline is three phases in
//! sequence — read it all, transform it all, print it all — rather than a flow. An upstream that
//! does not end has no end to read to, so the first phase never finishes and the second never
//! starts: `tail -f app.log | lines | where …` printed nothing at all, for ever, where
//! `tail -f app.log | grep ERROR` prints as it goes.
//!
//! # What it does instead
//!
//! Reads the upstream in slices, turns each slice into rows, pushes those through the verbs, and
//! prints what comes out — then goes back for more. Output appears as the data does, memory is
//! bounded by one slice, and when a verb has seen enough the reader is **closed**, which is what
//! gives the upstream its `SIGPIPE` and ends it. That is the mechanism `yes | head -2` has always
//! used, arriving in the structured half at last.
//!
//! # The prefix is forked, not re-implemented
//!
//! The upstream runs through `run_byte_stages` inside a child of this process, with its stdout on a
//! pipe. **Not a second way to run an external**: spawning it here with `std::process::Command`
//! would mean re-deriving argv, the environment, `$PATH` resolution and the exit status, and any of
//! those drifting from the byte path is a bug that only shows up in a structured pipeline. A fork
//! that calls the same function is exact by construction, and one extra process is what a subshell
//! costs anyway.
//!
//! # Where it does *not* apply, and why the list is short
//!
//! A pipeline is streamed only when every part of it can be, and the fallback is today's path
//! unchanged. See [`plan`]. The two rules worth stating:
//!
//! * **The bridge has to answer as it reads.** `lines` and `parse` answer a row per line, and
//!   `from csv`/`from tsv` a row per *record* — see [`delimited`], where a record may span lines. A slice
//!   of input is a batch of rows. `from json` needs the closing brace before it can answer at all,
//!   and `detect-columns` needs every row before it can say where the columns are — neither is a
//!   thing a stream can give.
//! * **Every verb has to be row-local, one of the four that count, or one of the two that fold.**
//!   Applying `where` to a batch is exactly applying it to each row, so batching is invisible.
//!   Applying `first 2` to each batch would take two rows *per batch*, which is a wrong answer — so
//!   `first`, `skip`, `every` and `enumerate` carry their count across batches instead. `length`
//!   and `final n` answer only at the end but hold a **bound** while they wait — a counter, and n
//!   rows. Anything that has to hold the whole stream to answer — `sort-by`, `group-by`, `stats`,
//!   `reverse` — is not streamable at all, and says so by not being in a list.
//!
//! # A stream cannot be a table
//!
//! The drawn face aligns columns to their widest value, which is a question only the last row can
//! answer. A stream has no last row, so streamed output is a header and then one line per row, each
//! cell rendered for a person but not padded. The alternative is holding every row to align it,
//! which is the thing this module exists not to do.

/// Streaming a delimited document, where a record may span lines and the header names them all.

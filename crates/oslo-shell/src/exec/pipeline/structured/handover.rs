//! Where the structured half stops and the byte half takes over.
//!
//! ```text
//! ls | first 2 | cat
//! └──── rows ────┘   └─ bytes: rendered, and handed over as this stage's standard input
//! ```
//!
//! # The mirror of the byte prefix, and it was the missing half
//!
//! [`super::run`] already lets an external command *lead*: `kubectl get pods -o json | from json |
//! where …` runs the prefix on the byte path and gives its output to the first tool. The other
//! direction had no answer at all. A tool followed by anything that is not a tool fell back for the
//! **whole** pipeline, and on that path the verbs are not commands:
//!
//! ```text
//! $ ls | first 2 | cat
//! oslo: first: command not found
//! $ echo $?
//! 0
//! ```
//!
//! Empty output, status 0 — and the structured `ls` had already run before the fallback re-ran the
//! line from the start, so a tool with a side effect performed it twice. That is the failure
//! `docs/known-gaps.md` opens by saying oslo does not have, so it does not get to stay.
//!
//! # Rendered as transport, never as a table
//!
//! What crosses is [`crate::data::render_transport`] — plain, complete, untruncated. The drawn
//! table with its box-drawing characters is for a person looking at a terminal; putting it on
//! another program's standard input is the exact failure the structured design exists to prevent.
//!
//! # A tool that prints, not just one that produces rows
//!
//! `to json` writes with `println!` and hands back nothing — it is a *bytes* producer, and that is
//! how `df | to json` puts JSON on the terminal. So carrying only the rows across the seam left
//! `ps | first 3 | to json | jq .` giving jq an empty input while the JSON went straight to the
//! shell's own stdout: the filter silently did nothing.
//!
//! Whether a byte suffix exists is knowable *before* any stage runs — it is the first stage that is
//! not a tool — so when there is one, the tool half's stdout is pointed at a scratch file for its
//! duration. What crosses is then everything the tools said, printed or produced.
//!
//! # A file, not a pipe
//!
//! The rows are written to a temporary file which becomes the suffix's standard input. A pipe would
//! deadlock: this process cannot write a megabyte of rendered rows into one before the child it is
//! writing to has started reading, and the child cannot start until the write returns. The same
//! reasoning, and the same `tempfile`, as `exec::pipeline::coordinates`.

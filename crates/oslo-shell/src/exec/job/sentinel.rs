//! Ctrl-C enough times takes the terminal back from a job that will not listen.
//!
//! Off unless `oslo.misc.interrupt_escape` is set to how many presses it should take. Nothing here
//! runs — not even the fork — in a shell that has not asked for it.
//!
//! # Why this needs a second process at all
//!
//! A shell doing job control is **not in the terminal's foreground process group** — it hands that
//! to the job so the job can read the terminal and receive Ctrl-C. The kernel delivers the tty's
//! `SIGINT` to the foreground group and nowhere else, so the shell, sitting in `waitpid`, never
//! learns a key was pressed. Everything oslo knows about an interrupted command it infers *after
//! the fact*, from the child's wait status — see [`super::super::simple::external`].
//!
//! That inference is enough for a job that dies. It is no use at all for one that does not:
//!
//! ```text
//! $ sh -c 'trap "" INT; sleep 300'
//! ^C ^C ^C          nothing happens, and nothing can — the shell is not being signalled
//! ```
//!
//! Something has to *observe* the Ctrl-C and act, and the only way to observe it is to be in the
//! group the kernel is signalling.
//!
//! So: one small process, forked once per interactive session, that joins whichever process group
//! currently owns the terminal and counts the interrupts it receives. It reads no input, writes no
//! output, and holds no terminal.
//!
//! # It stops the job; it does not kill it
//!
//! `SIGSTOP`, not `SIGKILL`, and the difference is most of the value. It cannot be caught or
//! ignored — so it works on exactly the programs this exists for — and `waitpid` already returns
//! `Stopped` for it, which means the shell's existing path takes over: the job goes into the job
//! table, the terminal comes back, and the prompt returns. Nothing is destroyed. `fg`, `bg` and
//! `kill %1` all then work on it, so the decision about what to do with a job that will not
//! listen stays with the person, where it belongs.
//!
//! That also means there is **no new signal aimed at the shell**, and so nothing for a user `trap`
//! to collide with — a shell-side handler could be replaced by `trap ... USR1` and the feature
//! would silently stop working.
//!
//! # What it will not save you from
//!
//! **A process wedged in an uninterruptible kernel call.** `SIGSTOP` is recorded and delivered when
//! the syscall returns, exactly as `SIGKILL` is, so a task blocked on a dead NFS mount is beyond
//! this and beyond everything else. What this helps with is a program that catches or ignores the
//! interrupt, or spins retrying it, which is the case a person can otherwise do nothing about.
//!
//! # The counter resets per job, not on a timer
//!
//! Three presses *during one command* escalate. A window would need a clock and would make the
//! behaviour depend on how fast somebody types; "I have now asked three times and it is still
//! there" is the thing being expressed, and it is as true over ten seconds as over one.

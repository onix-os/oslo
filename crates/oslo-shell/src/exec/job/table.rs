//! The job table: what the shell remembers about the children it is not currently waiting for.
//!
//! R7.2/R7.4. Before this existed, `JobManager::add_job` had no callers, [`JobState::Stopped`] was
//! unreachable, and a background child that finished stayed a zombie for the shell's lifetime
//! because nothing ever waited for it. Both halves are fixed here: every background job and every
//! stopped foreground job is recorded, and [`reap_background_jobs`] — called at every command
//! boundary by [`crate::exec::pipeline::eval_command_list`] — collects the ones that have ended.
//!
//! # The reaping invariant
//!
//! [`reap_background_jobs`] runs at command boundaries and asks after each *known* pid with
//! `WNOHANG`, never `waitpid(-1)`. Both would collect the same zombies, but `-1` also collects
//! children this table has never heard of — and the statuses it collects are kept in
//! [`JobTable::take_status`] so that a later `wait` can still report them, which is what keeps
//! opportunistic reaping from stealing `wait $!`'s answer.

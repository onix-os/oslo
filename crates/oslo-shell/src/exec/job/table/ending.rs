//! What the table does when a child ends.
//!
//! Split from the table itself because it answers a different question. [`super`] is about *naming*
//! a job — `%1`, `%+`, the substring you typed — and about what `jobs` prints. This is the moment a
//! process reports, which is where the accounting has to be exactly right: a status consumed twice
//! is a `wait` that lies, and one never consumed is a zombie for the rest of the session.
//!
//! Nothing here announces anything. Every transition is queued on the table and fired by
//! [`crate::exec::job::reap`] once its lock is released — a Lua handler may ask the shell about its
//! jobs, so firing from in here would be a handler waiting for a lock its own caller holds.

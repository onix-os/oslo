//! The stack of streams a coordinate reads from, and substituting one into a command's words.
//!
//! A *stream* is text something produced: a pipeline stage that has finished, or a whole command at
//! the prompt. Both go on the same stack, so stepping back through a pipeline and stepping back
//! through the session are the same motion — see [`oslo_base::coords`] for the coordinate itself.
//!
//! # Which way the index goes
//!
//! ```text
//! cat hosts.txt | grep web | ssh {0:0}
//!                      │           └─ 0  this stage's input: what `grep web` printed
//!                      └───────────── 1  one stage further back: what `cat` printed
//!
//! ssh {-1:0:0}   ← -1  the previous prompt, whatever it was
//! ```
//!
//! **Zero and up walk back through this pipeline; below zero walks back through the session.** They
//! are different collections and giving them one axis would mean `{3:…}` silently crossing from one
//! into the other when a pipeline happened to be short. The sign says which you meant, and it reads
//! the way negative indices already read on a line: from the other end.
//!
//! # A value is one argument
//!
//! Substitution happens on the **syntax tree**, before any expansion runs, and every value becomes
//! a single-quoted word part. Single quotes are literal throughout in every shell there is, so a
//! line holding a space, a `*` or a `$` arrives at the command whole and is never field-split or
//! re-globbed. Reusing the quoting the shell already has beats inventing a new origin and teaching
//! six expansions about it — and a shell that field-splits its own substitutions is a shell that
//! executes filenames.

//! Functions kept one to a file and read the first time they are called.
//!
//! `~/.config/oslo/functions/NAME.sh` defines `NAME`, and is not read until something calls it.
//! fish's `functions/` directory, and the reason it is worth copying is arithmetic: a `conf.d`
//! snippet that defines twenty functions costs twenty function definitions on **every** shell
//! start, including the hundred short-lived ones a build spawns. An autoloaded one costs a
//! `stat(2)` on the call that needs it and nothing at all otherwise.
//!
//! # It can never shadow anything
//!
//! The lookup happens **after** the PATH search has already failed. A file named `ls.sh` is
//! therefore dead: `ls` resolves to the program long before this is reached. That is deliberate
//! and it is the conservative half of the trade — fish lets an autoloaded function override a
//! command, which is useful about once and surprising the rest of the time, and a shell that
//! promises scripts see POSIX behaviour cannot have a file on disk quietly redefining `test`.
//!
//! So: autoloading adds names, it never changes existing ones.
//!
//! # A file that does not define its function
//!
//! Reported once, as a mistake, rather than falling through to "command not found" — because the
//! file plainly exists and the user plainly meant it to work, and the useful message names the
//! discrepancy instead of denying the file was there.

//! What POSIX mode changes about the *outcome* of a command.
//!
//! POSIX 2.8.1 says a non-interactive shell exits when a **special builtin** hits a utility error
//! and when a **variable assignment error** happens. Both rules are narrower than they first look,
//! and getting them wrong in the generous direction kills the shell on ordinary failures. Measured
//! against `bash --posix -c`:
//!
//! ```text
//! shift 5; echo alive              diagnostic, "alive", status 0   -- shift is special, not fatal
//! export BAD-NAME=1; echo alive    diagnostic, no "alive", status 1 -- fatal
//! set -o nosuchopt; echo alive     diagnostic, no "alive", status 2 -- fatal, `set`'s own status
//! readonly r=1; r=2; echo alive    diagnostic, no "alive", status 127 -- fatal
//! : > /nonexistent/x; echo alive   diagnostic, no "alive", status 1 -- fatal
//! echo hi > /nonexistent/x; …      diagnostic, "alive", status 0    -- `echo` is not special
//! false; cd /nowhere; command -Z   all carry on
//! ```
//!
//! So the rule is *utility error*, not *non-zero status*: `shift 5` returns non-zero and lives.
//! A builtin says which it had by returning [`ShellError::UtilityError`] rather than `Ok(n)`;
//! there is no other way to tell, because a usage error is an ordinary `Ok(2)`.
//!
//! Fatal here means `ShellError::Exit`, not a new unwinding path: `exit` is already the thing the
//! whole evaluator knows how to carry — a subshell absorbs it and the parent carries on
//! (`bash --posix -c '(readonly r=1; r=2); echo outer'` prints `outer`), a function does not, and
//! the EXIT trap still runs.

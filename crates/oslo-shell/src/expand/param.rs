//! Parameter expansion: `$x`, `${x}`, and every `${x<op>word}` operator.
//!
//! Two rules shape this module.
//!
//! The first is that an *operand is a word, not a string*. `${x:-$HOME}` has to expand its
//! default and `${x:=$y}` has to persist the expanded text, so every payload arrives as a
//! [`oslo_base::ast::Word`] and is expanded here, with quote removal, when the operator needs it.
//!
//! The second is that an unrecognised `${...}` body is an **error**. The lexer hands anything it
//! cannot parse through as a parameter *name*; looking that up would answer `""` for every form
//! the shell does not implement, and a wrong-but-quiet empty string is precisely how nine
//! separate unimplemented operators went unnoticed. Rejecting a body that is not a name turns
//! that fallback into a diagnostic instead.

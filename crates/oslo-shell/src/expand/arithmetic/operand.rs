//! Expansion of the expression *text*, before any of it is read as arithmetic.
//!
//! POSIX makes `$(( … ))` two steps rather than one: the expression first undergoes parameter
//! expansion, command substitution and quote removal, and only the text that survives is
//! arithmetic. Collapsing the two is what made `$(( $(wc -l < f) * 2 ))` abort the whole command —
//! the `$` reached the arithmetic tokeniser, which has no token for it — and what left
//! `$(($1 - 1))` unable to see a positional parameter.
//!
//! The expansion machinery is the word expander's, reused rather than reimplemented, so `${#s}`,
//! backticks and nested `$(( ))` all mean here exactly what they mean in a command word. There is
//! one deliberate exception, and it is the reason this is not a bare call to
//! [`crate::expand::expand_word_to_string`]: a leading `~` is the bitwise-NOT operator in an
//! arithmetic expression, not a home directory.

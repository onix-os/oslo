//!
//! A stored macro func or script, and an autoloaded function. Dispatch finds each of them by asking
//! at the moment of the call, which is right for dispatch and useless to the interface: the
//! highlighter, the completer, the ghost and the correction all need the *set*, and they need it
//! without a database open per keystroke.
//!
//! So it is gathered here and published to [`oslo_base::vocab`], which is what those four read.
//! Gathered once per prompt rather than per keystroke — the set cannot change while a line is being
//! typed in a way that matters — and again the moment this shell writes to the store, so
//! `oslo macros add` is never followed by a prompt that denies the thing it just made.

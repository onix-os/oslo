//! Alias substitution, done where POSIX puts it: on the source text, before it is parsed.
//!
//! oslo used to substitute aliases at *execution* time, replacing a simple command's first word
//! with the alias body. That is enough for `alias ll='ls -la'` and wrong for everything else,
//! because an alias body is not a list of arguments — it is **source text**, and it is allowed to
//! contain anything. `alias forever='while :; do'` is a real idiom (modernish's `mktemp` module
//! opens its retry loop with it); expanding it after parsing cannot work, because by then the
//! `done` at the other end has already been a syntax error.
//!
//! ## What decides a substitution
//!
//! A word is substituted when it is in *command position* — the first word of a simple command —
//! and when it is a plain name. Three further rules, each of which real scripts depend on:
//!
//! * **Chaining.** The replacement is rescanned, so `alias ll='ls -la'` over `alias ls='echo LS'`
//!   yields `echo LS -la`. A name already being expanded is not expanded again, which is what
//!   makes the near-universal `alias ls='ls -F'` terminate.
//! * **A trailing blank.** If an alias body ends with a blank, the *next* word is a candidate too.
//!   That is how `alias sudo='sudo '` makes `sudo ll` work.
//! * **Definitions in the text itself.** A script may define an alias and use it further down, and
//!   bash allows that because it parses one command at a time. oslo parses a whole unit at once,
//!   so this scanner reads `alias name=value` commands as it walks and honours them from the
//!   *following line* onward — which is exactly where bash starts honouring them, and why
//!   `alias x=y; x` on one line finds no `x` in either shell.
//!
//! Quoted text, comments and here-document bodies are copied through untouched. The heredoc rule
//! is not a nicety: `config.guess` writes a C program through `<<EOF`, and a body is data.

//! The verbs that make a stream *smaller*: `group-by`, `count`, `distinct`, `stats`.
//!
//! ```text
//! ps | group-by user | count
//! ls | distinct kind
//! df | stats free
//! ```
//!
//! # Why these are the ones worth adding
//!
//! Every verb oslo had was **selection** — `where`, `cols`, `first`, `sort-by`. Selection keeps rows
//! and throws rows away; none of it can answer *how many*, *which distinct*, or *how much in total*.
//! That is the difference between rows being a nicer `awk` and being a different tool: `ps |
//! group-by user | count` is a query `ps | grep` cannot express at all.
//!
//! **In Rust, though a Lua tool could now do it.** These are what every pipeline reaches for, so
//! they have to exist in `oslo-minimal` and be fast enough that nobody drops back to
//! `sort | uniq -c`.
//!
//! # `join` is not here
//!
//! It needs a *second* input stream, and oslo's pipeline is a line — there is no shape for "and also
//! read this". Adding one is a change to the pipeline, not another verb, and pretending otherwise
//! would mean a `join` that reads its other side from somewhere the planner cannot see.

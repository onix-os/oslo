//! `history` as rows — what this shell has already been asked to do.
//!
//! ```text
//! history | where 'worked == false' | sort-by last | final 10
//! history | where 'places == 1'                      -- what belongs to one project
//! history | group-by dir | sort-by count
//! ```
//!
//! # Why this one is worth being a producer
//!
//! Forty verbs could be pointed at three things — `ls`, `ps` and `df`. Meanwhile the shell was
//! already writing down, for every command anyone ran, how long it took, whether it worked, where
//! it ran, how many *distinct* places it has run in, and which worktree it belonged to. None of it
//! was answerable: `oslo history` prints, and printing is where a question about the data stops.
//!
//! The store is folded per *line*, not per run — the same shape the finder reads — so a command run
//! four hundred times is one row that says four hundred. That is what makes `sort-by runs` mean
//! "what do I actually do" rather than "what did I do most recently".
//!
//! # The columns are typed, so the questions are arithmetic
//!
//! `last` is a [`Val::Time`] and not a rendering, so it draws as a date and compares as a number:
//! `where 'last > 2days'` is the units syntax working on it, and `sort-by last` is chronological
//! rather than alphabetical. `runs` and `places` are counts. This is the whole argument for the
//! typed kinds, applied to the one table the shell writes for itself.
//!
//! # `history` alone is still `history`
//!
//! The name is a shell builtin everywhere, so this is the fourth deliberate collision after `ls`,
//! `ps` and `df`, and it follows their rule exactly: a lone `history` is the builtin, printing
//! numbered lines as bash does, because a single stage has no edge and no edge can carry rows.
//! Structure is what you get by piping it somewhere.
